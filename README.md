Some scripts that I use to do stuff work at [martyr⁠—](https://martyr.shop)

### 🗃️ creative-index-list

Notion table to proper html format used here → [Digital Assets Index](https://martyr.shop/blogs/posts/digital-assets-index)

### 📕 guide-maker

[SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) HTML guides and manuals for martyr⁠— assets and products

### 📷 images-to-lazysizes

Script to turn Shopify images into [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) compatible format. I use it for images uploaded in blog articles, pages and random assets around the site.

## 🔧 release-builder-utils
Commands and scripts I use to automate long repetitive tasks when it comes to handle release files, be it for final release or unzipping them for some reason (change the content, updates, etc).

## 🏗️ force-shopify-image-build
Shopify processes and caches the images for the site. If the image hasn't been processed or cached before, it will do it when the page has been requested, resulting in slow load times. For a snappier user experience, this script will scrap every image link in every product and force Shopify to process and cache them.
